# Data Science in 30 Minutes

Check out `neural_nets.ipynb` for the full talk and example code for building a `word2vec` Neural Network in Python.

## System requirements

- Ipython notebook, numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- `gensim` (a C compiler will allow you to train more quickly, though isn't necessary).

You can easily install all of the above with Continuum Analytics' [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) - if you haven't heard of it yet, we'd highly recommend taking a look!

The easiest way to install all these packages is the following, once you've gotten conda installed:

``` 
conda create --name ds30 --file environment.yaml
```

Once you've gotten the python requirments installed, you can run `ipython notebook` from this directory and follow along.
