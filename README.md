# Data Science in 30 minutes
A quick demo illustrating a few data science techniques, and in under 30 minutes!

## Requirements:
You'll need to install the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Install twitter credentials:
Next, you will also need to sign up for twitter, obtain API credentials, and add those credentials to `twitter_secrets.json.nogit` (this file is intentionally ignored by git).  You can obtain your API credentials on the [Twitter API page](http://apps.twitter.com/)

```
ipython notebook
```

Then go to `localhost:8888` and click on `DS30.ipynb` to view the example
