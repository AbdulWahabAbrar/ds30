# Data Science in 30 Minutes

Check out `neural_nets.ipynb` for the full talk and example code for building a `word2vec` Neural Network in Python.

## System requirements

- Ipython notebook, numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- `gensim` (a C compiler will allow you to train more quickly, though isn't necessary).


## Installation
You can easily install all of the above with Continuum Analytics' [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/) - if you haven't heard of it yet, we'd highly recommend taking a look!

The easiest way to install all these packages is the following, once you've gotten conda installed:

``` 
conda create --name ds30 --file environment.yaml
```

## Pre-trained model to download (optional)
We use the following dataset in a few examples. Warning: It's 1.5GB, so sit back and relax while the download happens!

## Run:
To run this demo, you will need to startup an ipython notebook instance:
```
ipython notebook
```

Then go to `http://localhost:8888` and click on `neural_nets.ipynb`

## More:
This is meant to just give you a brief guided tour of just a few topics in data science.
